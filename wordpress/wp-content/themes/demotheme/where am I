Got both navs kinda working. Time to start adding in all other pages. Each page will have to be brought in as a template. 

Start working on pages like News that will updated via posts. News is already started

Work on form page to see if it works in wordpress. 

Work on iFrame from adoption page to get it to be responsive. 

Need to really work on Posts/Pages. I have News Page working kind of... but I want it to pull posts... not just what's typed on the page. SEE LINK BELOW
