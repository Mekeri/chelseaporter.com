 		<h2>Cornhole Tournament</h2>
    
 		<div><!--Third Accordian Start-->
			<h2 class="accordian">PLAY OF THE GAME</h2>
      
          <p><strong>Section A. Singles Or Doubles Play -</strong> Cornhole / Corn Toss can be played  as doubles or singles. In doubles play two contestants are partners against  another team of two contestants; in singles play a contestant competes against  another contestant. In doubles play, one member of each team pitches from one  cornhole platform and the other members pitch from the other cornhole platform.  In singles play, both contestants pitch from the same cornhole platform. All  other rules are basically the same for doubles or singles play. </p>
          <p><strong>Section B. Innings -</strong> Every Cornhole / Corn Toss match is  broken down into innings of play. During each inning of play each contestant  must pitch all four corn bags.</p>
				  <p><strong>Section C. -</strong> Value Of The Corn Bag - <br>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Corn Bag In-The-Hole -</strong> A corn bag in-the-hole (or Hole-In) is a  corn bag which is thrown through the hole in the cornhole platform or otherwise  comes to rest inside the cornhole platform (knocked in by another player or an  act of God). A corn bag in-the-hole has a value of three points.</li>
              <li><strong>Corn Bag In-The-Count -</strong> A corn bag that is not in-the-hole but  lands with any portion of the corn bag resting on the cornhole platform is  in-the-count. A corn bag in-the-count has a value of one point. For a corn bag  to be in-the-count, it must not touch the ground or any other portion of the  court prior to coming to rest on the cornhole platform. If a corn bag touches  the ground before coming to rest on the cornhole platform, it is a foul and  must be removed from the cornhole platform prior to the continuation of play.</li>
              <li><strong>Corn Bag Out-Of-The-Count -</strong> A corn bag which comes to rest  anywhere except in-the-count or in-the-hole is out-of-the-count and has no  scoring value. A corn bag which is declared to be a foul is considered to be  out-of-the-count (no matter where it comes to rest) and must be removed from  the cornhole surface prior to the continuation of play.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Section D. Delivery Of Corn Bags -</strong> <br>
  					<ol>
              <li>In doubles play, the first side of contestants alternate  pitching corn bags until they have thrown all four corn bags, then the  remaining contestant (pitching from the other cornhole platform) continue to  alternate in the same manner until all four corn bags are delivered and the  inning completed. Delivery in singles play is handled in the same manner (but  from the same platform) with each of the two contestants alternating their  pitching of corn bags until all four corn bags have been pitched completing the  inning. </li>
      
              <li> A contestant may deliver the corn bag from either the left or  right pitchers box (see above) but, in any one inning, all corn bags must be  delivered from the same pitcher&rsquo;s box. A contestant shall pitch the entire  tournament with the same hand or arm, except in the case of a medical  emergency. </li>
      
              <li> Each individual contestant shall deliver the corn bag within 20  seconds. The time shall start when the contestant steps onto the pitcher&rsquo;s box  with the intention of pitching. </li>
  					</ol>
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Section E. Pitching Rotation During The Game - </strong> The contestant who scored in the preceding inning shall pitch first in the next  inning. If neither pitcher scores, the contestant who pitched second (last) in  the preceding inning shall pitch first in the next inning.</p>
					<p><strong>Section F. Position Of Contestants During Delivery - </strong><br>
						<ol>
              <li> The pitcher must maintain constant contact with the designated  pitcher&rsquo;s box (See diagram above) during the entire address and release of the  corn bag. The only exception is for junior and physically challenged  contestants, who must simply remain completely behind the 21 ft. foul line when  the corn bag is released. The opponent, while not pitching, shall stand behind  the cornhole platform at least 2 feet to the rear of the contestant who is  pitching. After a short distance contestant (junior or physically challenged)  pitches first they must return to the cornhole platform if the opponent or any  contestant on an adjacent court is a full distance pitcher. </li>
    
              <li>If both contestants use the same pitchers box to deliver their  corn bags, the contestant pitching first should cross over to the other  pitchers box in front of the cornhole platform and then move to the proper  position. (see #1 above) As the first contestant is crossing in front the  second contestant should be crossing over in back and mounting the pitchers box  from the rear. If both contestants use opposite pitchers boxes, the contestant  who pitches first should step directly back to the proper position described in  #1 of this section.</li>
						</ol>
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Section G. Foul Corn Bags -</strong> A foul corn bag is a corn bag which  was delivered in non-compliance with one of the rules of the game. It scores as  a corn bag out of the count and is to be removed from the Cornhole / Corn Toss  court before any more corn bags are pitched. Corn bags already in the court  that have been knocked into foul territory by a foul corn bag should be returned  to the scoring area. Additionally, corn bags that are in the count, but are  knocked into the hole by a foul corn bag must be returned to their original  scoring position.
  					<ol>
          		<li>The following are rule violations that must be spotted and  called by an contestant or assigned judge. The penalty is to declare the corn  bag a foul corn bag, which requires the corn bags to be removed from the court  prior to resuming play. </li>
          		 <ol start="1" type="a"> 
               	<li>Any corn bag pitched when the contestant has made contact with  or crossed over the foul line before the corn bag is released. </li>

          			<li>Except as provided above, any corn bag pitched when the  contestant has started or stepped completely outside the pitching box before  releasing the corn bag.</li>

          			<li>Any corn bag not delivered within the twenty second time  limit.</li>

          			<li>A corn bag pitched from a different pitchers box than the  first corn bag.</li>

          			<li>Any corn bag that contacted the court or the ground before  coming to rest on the cornhole platform. </li>

          			<li>Any corn bag which struck a previously defined object such as  a tree limb, wire, indoor court ceiling, etc. </li>

          			<li>Any corn bag that leaves a contestant's hand once the final  forward swing of the delivery process has started shall count as a pitched corn  bag. A corn bag that is accidentally dropped by a contestant before the final  forward swing has started shall not be considered foul and may be picked up and  pitched. </li>
 							</ol>
          <li>A contestant's corn bags shall be called foul if the contestant  removes any corn bag before the scoring of that corn bag has been agreed upon.  A judge shall be called if a decision cannot be reached. The judge shall  determine the scoring for the inning. </li>
         </ol></p>
         <p><strong>Section H. Protests - </strong>If a contestant desires to make a  protest, the protest shall be made to the judge or tournament official at the time  the problem occurs. The tournament judge shall make the final ruling on all  protests.</p>
      <h2 class="accordian">LENGTH OF THE GAME</h2>
        <p><strong>Section A. Point Limits - </strong>The Cornhole / Corn Toss match  shall be played until the first team of contestants reaches (or exceeds) 21  points at the completion of an inning. The winning team does not need to win by  two or more points. </p>
        <p><strong>Section B. The Inning Must Be finished - </strong> The Cornhole / Corn Toss match can never end in the middle of an inning. Thus,  if a team that pitches first reaches or exceeds 21 points, the game can not end  until the other side is allowed to pitch all of their corn bags and the inning  is completed.</p>
        <p><strong>Section C. Ties At The End Of An Inning –</strong> If  the Cornhole / Corn Toss match is tied at 21 or more at the end of an inning,  play continues until one team or the other achieves a higher score at the end  of an inning and wins the match.</p>
        <p><strong>Section D. Skunks -</strong> The game shall be played to 21  unless a team scores 7 or more points at the end of an inning before their  opponents score any points. It this case the game is a skunk and the team that  scores 7 or more points wins the match. </p>
   	  <h2 class="accordian">SCORING</h2>
          <p><strong>Section A. Cancellation Scoring - </strong>In cancellation scoring, corn bags  in-the-hole and corn bags in-the-count pitched by opponents during an inning or  half of an inning in doubles play cancel each other out. Only non cancelled  corn bags are counted in the score for the inning. <br>
            <ol>
            	<li>Corn Bags In-The-Hole – Hole-ins (HI&rsquo;s) cancel each other. A  corn bag in-the-hole of one contestant shall cancel a corn bag in-the-hole of  his competitor and those corn bags shall not score any points. Any non  cancelled corn bag in-the-hole scores three points.</li>
            	<li>Corn Bags In-The-Count – Corn bags in-the-count cancel each  other. A corn bag in-the-count of one contestant shall cancel a corn bags  in-the-count of the opponent and those corn bags shall not score any points.  Any non cancelled corn bags in-the-count score one point each.</li>
          	</ol>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Section B. Score Calculation - </strong>Cancellation scoring may be easily  calculated as follows: <br>
						<ol>
          		<li>The points of both contestants are calculated for hole-ins and  in-the-count corn bags.</li>
							<li>The points of the lowest scoring contestant for hole-in corn  bags are subtracted from the points of the highest scoring contestant for  hole-in corn bags. The result is the hole-in score for the highest scoring  contestant. The hole-in score for the lowest scoring contestant is zero.</li>
							<li>The points of the lowest scoring contestant for in-the-count  corn bags are subtracted from the points of the highest scoring contestant for  in-the-count corn bags. The result is the in-the-count score for the highest  scoring contestant. The in-the-count score for the lowest scoring contestant is  zero.</li>
							<li>The hole-in score for each contestant is added to the  in-the-count score for each contestant to derive the recorded score for the  inning.</li>
							<li>In this manner hole-in and in-the–count corn bags from each  contestant or team of contestants are cancelled out and only non cancelled corn  bags are counted in the score.</li>
  					</ol>
          </p>
					<p><strong>Section C. Individual Hole-In Percentage  Scoring (HI%) -</strong> For purposes of calculating individual  Cornhole / Corn Toss Hole-In percentages (see Rule 9 below) that is reported to  ACA by members for purposes of ACA ranking and awards, ALL corn bags pitched  in-the-hole are included in the total used to derive these percentages  including those that would be eliminated under cancellation scoring rules. Only  corn bags determined to be foul would be excluded from the individual  statistical scoring. </p>
          <p><strong>Section D. Recording The Score -</strong> In tournament play, the score sheet  shall be the official record of the game and will be used to submit the  Official Tournament Scoring Summaries to the ACA (see Rule 9 below).  Contestants are encouraged to pay close attention to the score at all times. It  is highly recommended that visible scoreboard (that all contestants can review  and verify for accuracy) be used to keep score during tournament play. If a  question or discrepancy occurs regarding the correct score, the contestant(s)  may approach the scorer between innings to rectify the situation. If the  discrepancy cannot be corrected to the satisfaction of both contestants, a  tournament judge shall be called to make the final decision. </p>
